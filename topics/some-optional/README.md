Here we learn about `Some`, which is an optional value. Optional is useful for those functions which might or might not return a value.

# Syntax

The syntax for having a value is

```rust
let return_value = Some(42);
```

The syntax for not having a value is

```rust
let return_value: <Option<Option()>> = None;
```
